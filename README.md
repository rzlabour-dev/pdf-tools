This structure gives you:

Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Modular design with reusable components

Multiple pages (Home, About, Privacy)

Easy to add more tools - just create new HTML files in the tools/ directory

Consistent navigation across all pages

Maintainable code with clear organization

To add more tools in the future:

Create a new HTML file in the tools/ folder

Create a corresponding JS file if needed

Add the tool to the navigation

Add a card to the home page

All pages share the same CSS and navigation system, making it easy to maintain and expand.
